Title: This book saved my life. No joke. Thank you Miriam Greenspan.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2020
Review: My counselor recommended this book. In one afternoon, very suddenly, my husband died and my house burned down. I lost everything. I lived the WORST day of my life. I fell into the depths of depression and despair. I had never experienced depression before. I did not want to live another day in such unbearable emotional and physical pain. I was surprised that my heart even continued to beat. This book showed me how to listen to and lean into my grief... to learn from it, to allow myself to experience it, not to just ‚Äúcope with it‚Äù, not to apologize for expressing it even when people were uncomfortable around me when I did. I found hope and peace, and have even experienced some joy. I‚Äôve learned about self-care. I cannot cover all the ways this book has made a difference in my life. ‚ÄúHealing Through the Dark Emotions‚Äú should be a must-read on everyone‚Äôs list.

Title: An unorthodox solution for an impossible task
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2015
Review: As a father dealing with child loss and trying to reconcile faith with reality, this book offers a very different approach. While I do not totally agree with Dr. Greenspan's personal theology, that is a sidebar to the core story. She offers an honest look at the entire psychological / pharmaceutical complex, how patients are treated, then offers a solution. While that solution is somewhat controversial, it makes far more sense than medicating ones pain. The concept of dealing head-on with pain through faith is nothing new, but the approach offered - with the techniques explained - is very refreshing.

It does not make the journey easier, there are no guarantees of complete healing, but there is the assurance that grief can be faithfully observed, understood and better accepted.

Title: There are no "NEGATIVE" Emotions!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2014
Review: Greenspan has written a down-to-earth, vulnerable, and theraputic book about a topic all of us have to experience every now and then: DARK EMOTIONS.
It's a topic no one likes to talk about--let alone experience--but it's a topic that is ultimately unavoidable because the emotions we would label "dark" or "negative" are themselves unavoidable. So Greenspan takes a long, hard, and honest look at these "negative" emotions through her book, using her own life experiences and those of her previous clients, and has concluded that these dark emotions only become "bad" or "negative" when they are ignored and avoided. In fact, she goes as far as to say that dark emotions are required for a healthy life when approached and processed in a courageous and reflective manner; and having gone through my own struggles with these dark emotions, I agree with her 100%!

So if you or someone you know struggles with dark emotions such as fear, grief, despair, or the like, give this book a shot and you might learn something about yourself in the process.

Title: Compassionate wisdom...
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2008
Review: I can't recommend this book highly enough... The author writes is a very direct, honest, down-to-earth style, yet what she has to say is extremely profound. Like the little boy who says, "look, but the emperor has no clothes", she compassionately yet clearly through the cultural myths and denial that envelop and alienate us from the truth of our own direct experience.

I came to this book having read plenty of other books already on "the shadow", "befriending our pain", the dangers of "spiritual bypass", etc. etc. etc. so I was initially concerned that I might find some of this material old-hat or repetitive. Instead, I was delighted to find that the author offers a fresh and original take on these valuable subjects from the perspective of both Jewish spirituality and mysticism, as well as from the wisdom of her own hard-won experience.

The stories that the author shares from her own life, as well as the stories of the clients who have been fortunate enough to have her as a therapist, point to the real possibility of transformation and healing, by learning to listen to the wisdom of the "dark emotions". I found this book highly inspiring, and would recommend it to anyone who wants to find their way through and beyond the truth of suffering...

While I have never met the author, I want to say a heartfelt "thank you" for having written such a powerfully moving book...

Title: A profound contemplation on the power of emotions
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2013
Review: Your emotions are so incredibly important. Deep healing and spiritual transformation always have an emotional component. And there are such sublime emotions available to us. But to experience them, we can't have an agenda about them. You can't say "I'm only going to feel the sublime feelings," or "I'm only going to have feelings that are worthy of a spiritual being." You have to be willing to experience them all, on their own terms. That's what this book is about. When you befriend the dark emotions you begin a journey into the rich and nuanced world of your inner self. This book prepares you for that journey and shows you how grief leads to gratitude, fear to joy, and despair to faith.

Title: In a malaise? Read this book.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2017
Review: A sobering reminder that the glass is both half full AND half empty. Anyone wishing they were brave enough to face the inevitable emotions of grief, fear, despair AND are interested in dealing with them in a transformative way (i.e. not trying to escape them), would do well to read Miriam Greenspan's well-written, thoughtful, experience-based and engaging book.

Title: Impactful clarity and depth changed my life forever more
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2015
Review: One of the most impactful and best books I have ever read. Truth so deep that it has completely changed my life. I am no longer numbing constantly. I have become someone who wishes to befriend all of my emotions. My other readings in this vein were crystallized by Miriam's depth of clarity and her personal story. May we all become so integrated to the emotional ecology of each other consciously that we can heal together.

Title: and then my best friend died of cancer
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2017
Review: So helpful. My closest cat friend died of cancer, then my husband died of Alzheimer's, and then my best friend died of cancer. This book was a great help in giving me helpful outlets and outlooks on how to handle the grief.
